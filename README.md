# List-Pagination-and-Filtering
A project I completed for Unit 2 of the Treehouse Techdegree program. 

For this project, I utilized vanilla JavaScript (no libraries) to create a dynamic pagination system for a list. My code appends a list of links to the bottom
of the page that allows a user to navigate through the number of individuals listed 10 at a time. When they click on the next link, the
next ten individuals are displayed and so on. The list is dynamic, so it updates automatically depending on the size of the list input.
